# To-Do List Web Application

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to manage tasks through a simple and intuitive interface.

## Project Overview

The To-Do List Web Application consists of three main sections:

1. **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks by entering a task description and time. Tasks are added to the list in ascending order based on their creation time.

2. **View Tasks**: Displays the list of tasks in ascending order. Users can mark tasks as completed, edit task descriptions, delete tasks individually, or clear all completed tasks at once.

3. **Contact**: Provides contact information, including your name, email, WhatsApp contact, and GitHub account links.

The application includes a feature to show a popup reminder when the time of a task matches the current local time.
